## Why TypeScript?

What is TypeScript, and why should you adopt it?

> TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

- Get rid of `undefined is not a function` and `null is not an object` once and for all.
- Enjoy API docs‚Ä¶ that are always up-to-date.
- Experience better developer productivity through top-notch editor support, including incredible autocomplete, guided refactoring, automatic imports, and more.
