## Using TypeScript With Ember Effectively

<!-- FIXME: Move this to a "Converting your app" section -->

### Incremental adoption

If you are porting an existing app to TypeScript, you can install this addon and migrate your files incrementally by changing their extensions from `.js` to `.ts`. As TypeScript starts to find errors (and it usually does!), make sure to celebrate your wins‚Äîeven if they're small!‚Äîwith your team, especially if some people are not convinced yet. We would also love to hear your stories!

Some specific tips for success on the technical front:

First, use the _strictest_ strictness settings that our typings allow (currently all strictness settings except `strictFunctionTypes`). While it may be tempting to start with the _loosest_ strictness settings and then to tighten them down as you go, this will actually mean that "getting your app type-checking" will become a repeated process‚Äîgetting it type-checking with every new strictness setting you enable‚Äîrather than something you do just once.

The full recommended _strictness_ settings in your `"compilerOptions"` hash (which are also the settings generated by the ember-cli-typescript blueprint):

```json {data-filename="tsconfig.json"}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Strictness settings -- you should *not* change these: Ember code is not
    // guaranteed to type check with these set to looser values.
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,

    // You should feel free to change these, especially if you are already
    // covering them via linting (e.g. with @typescript-eslint).
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true
  }
}
```

A good approach is to start at your "leaf" modules (the ones that don't import anything else from your app, only Ember or third-party types) and then work your way back inward toward the most core modules that are used everywhere. Often the highest-value modules are your Ember Data models and any core services that are used everywhere else in the app ‚Äì and those are also the ones that tend to have the most cascading effects (having to update _tons_ of other places in your app) when you type them later in the process.

Finally, leave `"noEmitOnError": true` (the default) in the `"compilerOptions"` hash in your `tsconfig.json`. This will fail your build if you have type errors, which gives you the fastest feedback as you add types.

![example of a build error during live reload](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108688/38774630-7d9224d4-403b-11e8-8dbc-87dad977a4c4.gif)

### What about missing types?

There are two schools of thought on how to handle things you don't have types for as you go:

- Liberally use `any` for them and come back and fill them in later. This will let you do the strictest strictness settings but with an escape hatch that lets you say "We will come back to this when we have more idea how to handle it." This approach lets you move faster, but means you will still have lots of runtime type errors: `any` just turns the type-checker _off_ for anything touching those modules. You‚Äôll have to come back later and clean those up, and you‚Äôll likely have more difficult refactorings to do at that time.

- Go more slowly, but write down at least minimally accurate types as you go. (This is easier if you follow the leaves-first strategy recommended above.) This is much slower going, and can feel harder because you can‚Äôt just skip over things. Once you complete the work for any given module, though, you can be confident that everything is solid and you won‚Äôt have to revisit it in the future.

There is an inherent tradeoff between these two approaches; which works best will depend on your team and your app.

### Install other types

You'll want to use other type definitions as much as possible. Many packages ship their own type definitions, and many others have community-maintained definitions from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), available in the `@types` name space. The first thing you should do is to look for types from other addons: it will mean writing `any` a lot less and getting a lot more help both from your editor and from the compiler.

### The `types` directory

During installation, we create a `types` directory in the root of your application and add a `"paths"` mapping that includes that directory in any type lookups TypeScript tries to do. This is convenient for a few things:

- global types for your package (see the next section)
- writing types for third-party/`vendor` packages which do not have any types
- developing types for an addon which you intend to upstream later

These are all fallbacks, of course, you should use the types supplied directly with a package

#### Global types for your package

At the root of your application or addon, we include a `types/<your app>` directory with an `index.d.ts` file in it. Anything which is part of your application but which must be declared globally can go in this file. For example, if you have data attached to the `Window` object when the page is loaded (for bootstrapping or whatever other reason), this is a good place to declare it.

In the case of applications (but not for addons), we also automatically include declarations for Ember's prototype extensions in this `index.d.ts` file, with the `Array` prototype extensions enabled and the `Function` prototype extensions commented out. You should configure them to match your own config (which we cannot check during installation). If you are [disabling Ember's prototype extensions](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.18.0/configuring-ember/disabling-prototype-extensions/), you can remove these declarations entirely; we include them because they're enabled in most Ember applications today.

#### Environment configuration typings

Along with the @types/ files mentioned above, ember-cli-typescript adds a starter interface for `config/environment.js` in `app/config/environment.d.ts`. This interface will likely require some changes to match your app.

We install this file because the actual `config/environment.js` is (a) not actually identical with the types as you inherit them in the content of an application, but rather a superset of what an application has access to, and (b) not in a the same location as the path at which you look it up. The actual `config/environment.js` file executes in Node during the build, and Ember CLI writes its result as `<my-app>/config/environment` into your build for consumption at runtime.

### String-keyed lookups

Ember makes heavy use of string-based APIs to allow for a high degree of dynamicism. With some limitations, you can nonetheless use TypeScript very effectively to get auto-complete/IntelliSense as well as to accurately type-check your applications.

A few of the most common speed-bumps are listed here to help make this easier:

#### Classic `get` or `set` methods

In general, the `this.get` and `this.set` methods on `EmberObject` subclasses and the standalone `get` and `set` functions will work as you'd expect _if_ you're doing lookups only a single layer deep. We do not provide support for deep key lookups like `get(someObj, 'a.b.c')`, because normal property access can works correctly across the whole Ember ecosystem since at least Ember and Ember Data 3.28.

Since regular property access ‚Äújust works‚Äù, and has for a very long time, you should migrate to using normal property access instead. TypeScript will help make this a smooth process by identifying where you need to handle null and undefined intermediate properties.

#### Service and controller injections

Ember looks up services with the `@service` decorator at runtime, using the name of the service being injected up as the default value‚Äîa clever bit of metaprogramming that makes for a nice developer experience. TypeScript cannot do this, because the name of the service to inject isn't available at compile time in the same way. (These same considerations apply to controller injections using the `@inject` decorator from `@ember/controller`.)

Since decorators do not currently have access to enough information to produce an appropriate type by themselves, we need to import and name the type explicitly. For example, we might have `MySession` service which defines a `login` method, defined as usual:

```typescript {data-filename="app/services/my-session.ts"}
import Service from '@ember/service';
import RSVP from 'rsvp';

export default class MySession extends Service {
  login(email: string, password: string): RSVP.Promise<string> {
    // login and return the confirmation message
  }
}

declare module '@ember/service' {
  interface Registry {
    'my-session': MySession;
  }
}
```

Then we can use the service as we usually would with a decorator, but adding a type annotation to it so TypeScript knows what it's looking at:

```typescript {data-filename="app/components/user-profile.ts"}
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

import type MySession from 'my-app/services/my-session';

export default class UserProfile extends Component {
  @service declare mySession: MySession;

  login(email: string, password: string) {
    this.mySession.login(email, password);
  }
}
```

Note that we need the `MySession` type annotation this way, but we _don't_ need the string lookup (unless we're giving the service a different name than the usual on the class, as in Ember injections in general). Without the type annotation, the type of `session` would just be `any`. This is because decorators are not allowed to modify the types of whatever they decorate. As a result, we wouldn't get any type-checking on that `session.login` call, and we wouldn't get any auto-completion either. Which would be really sad and take away a lot of the reason we're using TypeScript in the first place!

Also notice [the `declare` property modifier](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier). This tells TypeScript that the property will be configured by something outside the class (in this case, the decorator), and guarantees it emits spec-compliant JavaScript.

(This also holds true for all other service injections, computed property macros, and Ember Data model attributes and relationships.)

Finally, you may have noticed the `declare module` at the bottom of the example `MySession` definition:

```typescript {data-filename="app/services/my-session.ts"}
// ...
declare module '@ember/service' {
  interface Registry {
    'my-session': MySession;
  }
}
```

This definition allows for type-safe lookups with other Ember dependency injection APIs. For example, [the `Owner.lookup` method](https://api.emberjs.com/ember/5.2/classes/Owner#2-method) uses this "registration"‚Äîa mapping from the string `'my-session'` to the service type, `MySession`‚Äîto provide the correct type:

```typescript
function dynamicLookup(owner: Owner) {
  let mySession = owner.lookup('service:my-session');
  mySession.login('tom@example.com', 'password123');
}
```

#### Ember Data lookups

We use the same basic approach for Ember Data type lookups with string keys as we do for service injections, but here we take advantage of the string "type registration" for the runtime code as well. As a result, once you add the module and interface definitions for each model, serializer, and adapter in your app, you will automatically get type-checking and autocompletion and the correct return types for functions like `findRecord`, `queryRecord`, `adapterFor`, `serializerFor`, etc. No need to try to write out those (admittedly kind of hairy!) types; just write your Ember Data calls like normal and everything _should_ just work. That is, writing `this.store.findRecord('user', 1)` will give you back a `Promise<User | undefined>`.

The declarations and changes you need to add to your existing files are:

- Models

  ```typescript {data-filename="app/models/user-meta.ts"}
  import Model from '@ember-data/model';

  export default class UserMeta extends Model {}

  declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' {
    export default interface ModelRegistry {
      'user-meta': UserMeta;
    }
  }
  ```

- Adapters

  ```typescript {data-filename="app/adapters/user-meta.ts"}
  import Adapter from '@ember-data/adapter';

  export default class UserMeta extends Adapter {}

  declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/adapter' {
    export default interface AdapterRegistry {
      'user-meta': UserMeta;
    }
  }
  ```

- Serializers

  ```typescript {data-filename="app/serializers/user-meta.ts"}
  import Serializer from '@ember-data/serializer';

  export default class UserMeta extends Serializer {}

  declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/serializer' {
    export default interface SerializerRegistry {
      'user-meta': UserMeta;
    }
  }
  ```

- Transforms

  ```typescript {data-filename="app/transforms/color.ts"}
  import Transform from '@ember-data/serializer/transform';

  export default class ColorTransform extends Transform {}

  declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/transform' {
    export default interface TransformRegistry {
      color: ColorTransform;
    }
  }
  ```

##### Opt-in unsafety

Also notice that unlike with service and controller injections, there is no unsafe fallback method by default, because there isn't an argument-less variant of the functions to use as there is for `Service` and `Controller` injection. If for some reason you want to opt _out_ of the full type-safe lookup for the strings you pass into methods like `findRecord`, `adapterFor`, and `serializerFor`, you can add these declarations somewhere in your project:

```typescript {data-filename="types/ember-data.d.ts"}
import Model from '@ember-data/model';
import Adapter from '@ember-data/adapter';
import Serializer from '@ember-data/serializer';

declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' {
  export default interface ModelRegistry {
    [key: string]: Model;
  }
}
declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/adapter' {
  export default interface AdapterRegistry {
    [key: string]: Adapter;
  }
}
declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/serializer' {
  export default interface SerializerRegistry {
    [key: string]: Serializer;
  }
}
```

However, we _**strongly**_ recommend that you simply take the time to add the few lines of declarations to each of your `Model`, `Adapter`, and `Serializer` instances instead. It will save you time in even the short run!

##### Fixing the Ember Data `error TS2344` problem

If you're developing an Ember app or addon and _not_ using Ember Data (and accordingly not even have the Ember Data types installed), you may see an error like this and be confused:

```text
node_modules/@types/ember-data/index.d.ts(920,56): error TS2344: Type 'any' does not satisfy the constraint 'never'.
```

This happens because the types for Ember's _test_ tooling includes the types for Ember Data because the `this` value in several of Ember's test types can include a reference to the Ember Data `Store` class.

**The fix:** add a declaration like this in a new file named `ember-data.d.ts` in your `types` directory:

```typescript {data-filename="types/ember-data.d.ts"}
declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' {
  export default interface ModelRegistry {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  }
}
```

This works because (a) we include things in your types directory automatically and (b) TypeScript will merge this module and interface declaration with the main definitions for Ember Data from DefinitelyTyped behind the scenes.

If you're developing an addon and concerned that this might affect consumers, it won't. Your types directory will never be referenced by consumers at all!

## Decorators

Ember makes heavy use of decorators, and TypeScript does not currently support deriving type information from decorators.

As a result, there are three important points that apply to _all_ decorator usage in Ember:

1. Whenever using a decorator to declare a class field the framework sets up for you, you should mark it with `declare`. That includes all service and controller injections as well as all Ember Data attributes and relationships.

   Normally, TypeScript determines whether a property is definitely not `null` or `undefined` by checking what you do in the constructor. In the case of service injections, controller injections, or Ember Data model decorations, though, TypeScript does not have visibility into how instances of the class are _initialized_. The `declare` annotation informs TypeScript that a declaration is defined somewhere else, outside its scope.

2. For Ember Data Models, you will need to use the optional `?` operator on field declarations if the field is optional \(`?`\). See the Ember Data section of the guide for more details!

3. You are responsible to write the type correctly. TypeScript does not currently use decorator information at all in its type information. If you write `@service foo` or even `@service('foo') foo`, _Ember_ knows that this resolves at runtime to the service `Foo`, but TypeScript does not and‚Äîfor now‚Äî_cannot_.

   This means that you are responsible to provide this type information, and that you are responsible to make sure that the information remains correct and up to date

For examples, see the detailed discussions of the two main places decorators are used in the framework:

- [Services](../ember/services.md)
- [Ember Data Models](../ember-data/models.md)

## Current Limitations

While TS already works nicely for many things in Ember, there are a number of corners where it _won't_ help you out. Some of them are just a matter of further work on updating the [existing typings](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/ember); others are a matter of further support landing in TypeScript itself, or changes to Ember's object model.

### Some `import`s don't resolve

You'll frequently see errors for imports which TypeScript doesn't know how to resolve. **These won't stop the build from working;** they just mean TypeScript doesn't know where to find those.

Writing these missing type definitions is a great way to pitch in! Jump in `#topic-typescript` on the [Ember Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/zT3asNS) and we'll be happy to help you.

### Templates

Templates are currently totally non-type-checked. This means that you lose any safety when moving into a template context, even if using a Glimmer `Component` in Ember Octane.

<!-- FIXME: Move stuff to addon docs -->

Addons need to import templates from the associated `.hbs` file to bind to the layout of any components they export. The TypeScript compiler will report that it cannot resolve the module, since it does not know how to resolve files ending in `.hbs`. To resolve this, you can provide this set of definitions to `my-addon/types/global.d.ts`, which will allow the import to succeed:

```typescript {data-filename="my-addon/types/global.d.ts"}
declare module '*/template' {
  import { TemplateFactory } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';
  const template: TemplateFactory;
  export default template;
}

declare module 'app/templates/*' {
  import { TemplateFactory } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';
  const template: TemplateFactory;
  export default template;
}

declare module 'addon/templates/*' {
  import { TemplateFactory } from 'ember-cli-htmlbars';
  const template: TemplateFactory;
  export default template;
}
```

### Invoking actions

<!-- FIXME: Glint mention -->

TypeScript won't detect a mismatch between this action and the corresponding call in the template:

```typescript {data-filename="app/components/my-game.ts"}
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';

export default class MyGame extends Component {
  @action turnWheel(degrees: number) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

```handlebars {data-filename="app/components/my-game.hbs"}
<button {{on 'click' (fn this.turnWheel 'potato')}}>
  Click Me
</button>
```

Likewise, it won't notice a problem when you use the `send` method:

```typescript
// TypeScript compiler won't detect this type mismatch
this.send\('turnWheel', 'ALSO-NOT-A-NUMBER'\);
```

## Understanding the `@types` Package Names

You may be wondering why the packages added to your `package.json` and described in [**Installation: Other packages this addon installs**](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/tree/3a434def8b8c8214853cea0762940ccedb2256e8/docs/README.md#other-packages-this-addon-installs) are named things like `@types/ember__object` instead of something like `@types/@ember/object`. This is a conventional name used to allow both the compiler and the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) publishing infrastructure \([types-publisher](https://github.com/Microsoft/types-publisher)\) to handle scoped packages, documented under [**What about scoped packages?**](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master#what-about-scoped-packages) in [the DefinitelyTyped README](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master).
