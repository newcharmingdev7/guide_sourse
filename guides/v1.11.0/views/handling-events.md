Instead of having to register event listeners on elements you'd like to
respond to, simply implement the name of the event you want to respond to
as a method on your view.

For example, imagine we have a template like this:

```handlebars
{{#view "clickable"}}
  This is a clickable area!
{{/view}}
```

Let's implement `view:clickable` such that when it is
clicked, an alert is displayed:

```javascript {data-filename=app/views/clickable.js}
export default Ember.View.extend({
  click: function(evt) {
    alert("ClickableView was clicked!");
  }
});
```

Events bubble up from the target view to each parent view in succession,
until the root view. These values are read-only. If you want to
manually manage views in JavaScript (instead of creating them using
the `{{view}}` helper in Handlebars), see the `Ember.ContainerView`
documentation below.

###Sending Events

To have the click event from `view:clickable` affect the state of your application,
simply send an event to the view's controller:

````app/views/clickable.js
export default Ember.View.extend({
  click: function(evt) {
    this.get('controller').send('turnItUp', 11);
  }
});
````

If the controller has an action handler called `turnItUp`, it will be called:


````app/controllers/play-back.js
export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  actions: {
    turnItUp: function(level){
      //Do your thing
    }
  }
});
````

If it doesn't, the message will be passed to the current route:

````app/routes/play-back.js
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  actions: {
    turnItUp: function(level){
      //This won't be called if it's defined on controllers:play-back
    }
  }
});
````

To see a full listing of the `Ember.View` built-in events, see the
documentation section on [Event Names](http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.View.html#toc_event-names).
